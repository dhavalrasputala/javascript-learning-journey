/*Design a Sum All Numbers Algorithm
In this lab, you will need to design a sum all numbers algorithm.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a function named sumAll that accepts an array of two numbers.
sumAll([n, m]) should return the sum of n and m plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first. For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.
*/

const sumAll = (arr1,arr2) => {
  let sum = []
  if (arr1<arr2){
  for (let i = arr2;i<=arr1;i++){
    sum[i] += i
  }
  return sum
  } else {
    for(let i = arr1;i<=arr2;i++){
      sum[i] += i;
    }
    return sum
  }
}
console.log(sumAll([1, 4]))//10
