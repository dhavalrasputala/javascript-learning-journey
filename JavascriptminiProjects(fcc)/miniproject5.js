/* Implement a Value Remover Function
In this lab, you will create a function that takes an initial array as its first argument, followed by one or more additional arguments representing the values to remove.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have a destroyer function that accepts an array and one or more additional arguments.
The destroyer function should return a new array excluding all elements from the first argument that match any of the subsequent arguments.
The function must accept an indeterminate number of arguments.*/

function destroyer(arr,...args) {
  return arr.filter(x=>!args.includes(x));
}
console.log(destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3))
